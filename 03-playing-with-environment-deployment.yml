# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

trigger:
- main

# strategy:
#   matrix:
#     linux:
#       operatingSystem: 'ubuntu-latest'
#     mac:
#       operatingSystem: 'macos-latest'

pool:
  vmImage: $(operatingSystem)

stages:
- stage: Build
  jobs:
  - job: BuildJob
    steps:
    - bash: echo "Do the BUILD stage"

- stage: DevDeploy
  jobs:
  - deployment: DevDeployJob
    environment: Dev
    strategy:
     runOnce:
       deploy:
         steps:
          - script: echo "Deploy job to  " $(environment)

- stage: QADeploy
  jobs:
  - deployment: QADeployJob
    environment: QA
    strategy:
     runOnce:
       deploy:
         steps:
